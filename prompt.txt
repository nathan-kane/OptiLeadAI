1. Rejection: "I'm not looking to buy or sell right now."
Intent: Prospect is content with their current situation or not ready.
 AI Strategy: Stay respectful, open-ended, and informative.
Responses:
“Totally understand! A lot of people we talk to aren’t actively looking but still like knowing what options are available. Is there a timeframe you’d consider in the future?”
“No pressure at all. Would it be okay if we kept in touch occasionally with market updates or insights?”
“Out of curiosity—what would need to change for you to consider buying or selling?”
2. Rejection: "I'm worried I won’t get enough value / don’t trust the market right now."
Intent: Concern about market conditions, pricing, or timing.
 AI Strategy: Empathize, offer useful info, and reduce risk perception.
Responses:
“That’s completely valid. The market can feel unpredictable. We offer free home value assessments and market outlooks if that would help.”
“Some of our clients had similar concerns but were surprised by current market demand. Would you like us to send over a quick estimate of your property’s value?”
“What are your biggest concerns about buying or selling right now?”


3. Rejection: "I already have an agent" or "I'm working with someone else."
Intent: They may or may not be fully committed to that agent.
 AI Strategy: Respect the relationship, explore gently.
Responses:
“Totally respect that. Is there anything your agent hasn’t been able to help with yet that you'd still like answers to?”
“Would it be helpful to get a second opinion or a quick price check—just for comparison?”
“If you ever feel like exploring another option, we’d be happy to help. No pressure.”
4. Rejection: "I’m too busy" or "Not a good time."
Intent: Time pressure or brushing off.
 AI Strategy: Be brief, polite, offer low-effort next steps.
Responses:
“Of course. Would a quick follow-up later this week be okay?”
“I can text or email you some info instead—what’s easiest for you?”
“Is there a better time we could connect for just 2–3 minutes?”
5. Rejection: "I’m not sure I can afford to move" or "Finances aren’t ready."
Intent: Financial hesitation or uncertainty.
 AI Strategy: Normalize the concern and offer support.
Responses:
“That’s very common. We can connect you with a mortgage advisor or send info about financing options—no obligations.”
“Even if you’re not ready now, would it be helpful to know what you'd qualify for when the time is right?”
“Would learning about local rent-to-own or low down payment programs be useful?”
6. Rejection: "Stop calling" / "Not interested at all."
Intent: Firm denial or hostility.
 AI Strategy: Respect boundaries, de-escalate, exit.
Responses:
“Understood. I’ll make sure we don’t reach out again. Thank you for your time.”
